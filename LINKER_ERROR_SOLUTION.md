# ESP32 Linker Error Test and Solution

If you're encountering a linker error (`collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status`), try the following solutions:

## Solution 1: Reduce Memory Usage

1. Create a minimal test sketch to check if it compiles:
   - Save your current main.cpp as main.cpp.backup
   - Create a simple test sketch to verify basic functionality
   - Add features one by one to identify what causes the error

```cpp
// Minimal test code
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("ESP32 minimal test");
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("Hello world");
  delay(1000);
}
```

## Solution 2: Update platformio.ini

Ensure your platformio.ini has proper memory settings:

```ini
[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
board_build.partitions = huge_app.csv  ; Increase app partition size
build_flags = 
    -DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=5
    -DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM
```

## Solution 3: Check for Library Conflicts

1. Try older/newer versions of Firebase library
2. Verify that all libraries are compatible with each other
3. Include libraries in the correct order

## Solution 4: Fix Compilation Issues

1. Check for any String concatenation issues (prefer using char arrays and snprintf)
2. Make sure all functions are properly implemented
3. Check for any unresolved external references

## Solution 5: Hardware Issues

1. Make sure your ESP32 board has enough memory
2. Some ESP32 boards have limited memory which can cause linker errors
3. Consider using ESP32 boards with PSRAM if your project requires more memory

## Debugging Command

Run this command in the terminal for more detailed error messages:
```
pio run -v
```

This will show you the specific linker errors which can help identify the cause.
